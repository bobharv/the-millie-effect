        <p>I think skin is something most people take for granted, if you have good skin that is…</p>

        <p>Up until 2 years ago I never thought too much about my skin. I would once in awhile go through a phase where I wanted THE perfect skin to get rid of that ONE spot that popped up. I would look into what tablets I could take, what food I should be eating and the products I should be using but once the spot naturally disappeared the phase would end. </p>

        <p>I didn’t really need to worry about my skin - I rarely got spots, I never got acne, I wasn’t allergic to anything to cause rashes of inflammation. I was naturally skin lucky!</p>

        <p>2 years ago I developed a small patch of eczema on my shoulder, I bought some over the counter steroid cream and it seemed to go for a bit. It didn’t end there though, the eczema came back in full force and I soon had:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>3 patches on my back</li>
          <li>2 patches on my shoulders</li>
          <li>Under my armpit on both sides</li>
          <li>A small patch on my stomach</li>
          <li>Patches on the crease of my arms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can imagine, it was quite devastating (yes it seems extreme) but I was embarrassed about having my arms out, I didn’t want to wear anything showing my back or shoulders and going on hot holidays filled me with dread! </p>

        <p>My initial research gave me the diagnostic that it was discoid eczema. Discoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema. They can affect any part of the body but don’t usually affect the face or scalp. Take a look at this link to find out more about <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Eczema-(discoid)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">discoid eczema.</a></p>

        <p>I was happy that I had finally found what eczema I had and was ready to read the solution to it.. But unfortunately nobody knows why you get discoid eczema and there is no treatment. Back to step 1.</p>

        <p>I went to the doctors and they prescribed me with steroid cream and moisturiser for extreme dry skin, both of these helped but I wanted the solution and not a quick fix. I asked them if they would do allergy tests for me but I was told that eczema isn’t affected by allergies and would be something I came into contact with. I had very strong doubts about this!! </p>

        <p>So, for the last 2 years I have been testing what could have caused my eczema and I tried taking out of my diet both <b>coffee</b> and <b>dairy</b>.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately these didn’t really help, having no dairy in my diet did make me feel slightly more energetic and healthier but my eczema stayed :( and I didn’t really drink enough coffee in the first place to consider it being the cause. </p>

        <p>But here is what I did discover: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Tomatoes</b>: It seems tomatoes are one of the major causes of my eczema flare ups. It turns out that tomatoes and products containing tomato including tomato ketchup and spaghetti bolognese, are a huge threat as they are very rich sources of salicylates, amines and natural MSG. The three worst chemicals for triggering eczema.</li>
          <li><b>Washing Powder</b>:  Even now if I sleep in somebody else’s bed covers which has been washed with Fairy and smells wonderful my eczema has a tantrum! I am a lover of my clothes smelling like flowers as they come out the wash but have succumbed to using eco-friendly washing powder.</li>
          <li><b>Doctors</b>: Doctors are not necessarily the best people to diagnose you! They are very reluctant to give allergy or patch testing and will try you with a number of different over the counter creams way before they even consider referring you to a dermatologist.</li>
          <li><b>Dermatologists</b>: Dermatologists are expensive! They will charge around £200 for a consultation and a further £300 for a patch test. I personally wasn’t willing to pay these prices until I have exhausted all other options! </li>
          <li><b>Steroid Cream</b>: It’s not a solution but it does help! I have never been a fan of using steroid cream but it has become my life saver. When I have a big flare up I put a very small amount on my eczema ONCE and it pretty much disappears within the day. <b>Please don’t continue using it though, it’s very powerful and can weaken the skin causing the eczema to become worse! </b></li>
          <li><b>Go natural</b>: Natural products are my new best friends. Whenever I pick up skin care products I always check the ingredients and use the rule: <i>if can’t read the word then it’s very likely to not be natural.</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, my eczema is pretty much clearing itself up now! The patches on my back are gone, the patches under my arms are gone. The creases in my arms I still suffer with but they come and go and aren’t as red as they used to be! </p>

        <p>I am no longer worried about going on summer holidays and what I wear, skin confidence at last! </p>

        <p>Keep watching this space to find out more about how I tackled my eczema! </p>
