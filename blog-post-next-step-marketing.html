        <p>As a child you dreamt of a life where no one will have the right to tell you what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Secretly, or not so secretly, that’s what we all want now right? Well, blogging can afford us such freedom and luxuries.</p>

        <p>Among many other things such as, furthering my writing skills & learning HTML and CSS, having the freedom to write my own opinions about anything that catches my attention is massive factor in choosing to start my own blog. </p>

        <p>‘First blog’ hmm, I’m going to guess starting a blog with a white lie isn’t in the best practices guidelines. My first blog was actually created when I was about 11. It was called something along the lines of ‘my visions, thoughts and ideas’ and consisted of 2 blog posts. I think I quickly realised at the age of 11 I didn’t have many visions, thoughts and ideas that needed to be written on the world wide web for everybody to see.</p>

        <p>After my first failed attempt of writing a blog, the idea did cross my mind again. At college I went through a phase that I would be a war journalist and help save the world, I wanted to start writing about politics and tell people the truth about what really went on during wars. Once again, my brain caught up with my thoughts and I realised you have to be one brave person with a strong heart to take on that job. Blog attempt 2 was never started.</p>

        <p>At University I studied Media and Communication studies. After realising my career ambition to be a war journalist probably wasn’t quite right for me, I started to look into other journalism. I took a 2 week placement at the Argus, a local newspaper, and my dreams were soon crushed once again - I learnt very quickly that the definition of ‘journalism’ didn’t always mean ‘truth’. The words ‘have you finished that story yet’ were thrown around the office a lot and this is exactly what they were, stories. I didn’t necessarily think this was wrong, but I certainly wasn’t ready to hurt people with my writing and the opinions of a newspaper. </p>

        <p>Next step - marketing! </p>

        <p>So, you may think this is an odd choice as I had already crushed my own dream of becoming a journalist due to the uncomforting reality that, <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKx0xl858Dc.”>if you don’t read the news you’re uninformed. If you read the news you’re mis-informed</a>. So, why start a career where it’s a common preconception that marketing lies to manipulate potential customers? </p>

        <p>Well, I believe that marketers now have the ability to, not only market, but change the products they are selling. With analytics being more powerful than ever we have the power to let our company know what a product needs to do to be more satisfying for a customer. Eventually, if you’re doing the right research, putting your opinion across to the right people, your product shouldn’t need false advertising to sell.</p>

        <p>Third time lucky and at the young age of twenty-two I found my chosen career! And if you mix marketing with my ‘passion for fashion’ and anything e-commerce this is exactly what I will be blogging about. </p>

        <p>Wish me luck! </p>
